# Face_Verification_System

Simple Face Verification System using the Siamese Neural Network from (Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition) paper, I have modified the model architecture a little bit to perform better on face verification problem.

I used pytorch to build the Neural Network, I used also MTCNN model to extract the faces from the images and streamlit to make interactive web app.
